We are working on developing a deployable binary transformation tools that can
transform/instrument binary executables with relying on source code. Such
a binary transformation tool has a wide range of application such as binary
hardening, optimization, debugging etc. Ensuring deployability  of such a tool
involves ensuring

    i) low performance overhead.
   ii) Correct transformation (No change in behaviour of transformed program)
  iii) Compatibility with C++ exception handling functionality
   iv) Secure transformation (We execute what we instrument)

As a part of our research, we have developed SBR, a binary randomization tool
meant to harden executables against code reuse attacks using code randomization.
This work was published in ACSAC 2020.
